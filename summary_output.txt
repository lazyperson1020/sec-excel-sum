**Background**

The company has been involved in an ongoing dispute with the European Commission regarding state aid provided by Ireland to the company. The issue dates back to 1991 and 2007 when Ireland provided tax opinions that affected the allocation of profits from two subsidiaries' Irish branches.

**European Commission Decision (2016)**

In August 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland had granted state aid to the company by providing these tax opinions. The commission ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period June 2003 through December 2014.

**Appeals and Court Decisions**

The company and Ireland appealed this decision to the General Court of the European Union, which annulled the Commission's decision on July 15, 2020. However, the Commission appealed this decision to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in September 2020. A hearing was held on May 23, 2023, and a decision from the ECJ is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.

**Potential Impact**

The company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. This suggests that the company may have some protection against increased tax liabilities if the ECJ upholds the Commission's decision.
